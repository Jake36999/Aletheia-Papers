Public Attribution & Statement of Intellectual Property: The Aletheia Papers Series & Associated Works
Publication Date & Timestamp: May 28, 2025
Author: Jake McIntosh
Canonical Link: [[To be inserted upon publication]

Preamble
This document serves as a formal, public declaration of authorship and intellectual property origin for a series of interconnected works focused on ethical artificial intelligence, consciousness modeling, simulation theory, and semantic architecture. These works, collectively referred to under the umbrella of "The Aletheia Papers Series," represent original contributions by Jake McIntosh, developed from approximately May 2023 to the present.

The primary intent behind these works and their publication is to foster responsible innovation, ensure ethical considerations are foundational in AI development, and provide frameworks for understanding complex systemsâ€”intended for public benefit and guarded against misuse.

Core Intellectual Properties
1. Aletheia
Description:
An ethical reasoning and cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence, designed with a modular, lens-based structure to model integrity, empathy, and principled decision-making in dynamic and recursive environments.

Key Components:

Ethical Reasoning Engine

Lens-Based Modular Cognition System

YAML-Driven Identity & Style Configuration

2. Semantic Identity Engineering (SIE)
Description:
A methodology for constructing and guiding AI identity and behaviour through structured semantic frameworks and narrative-driven ethical pipelines, ensuring contextual continuity and principled alignment across sessions and deployments.

Key Components:

Linguistic Scaffolding & Prompt Engineering through Persistent Style

Reasoning Lenses & Narrative Identity Anchors

Integrated Ethics Pipeline with Refusal and Override Conditions

3. Informational Resonance and the Emergence of Reality (IRER) Framework
Description:
A theoretical framework exploring the nature of reality through an informational and resonance-based lens, proposing mechanisms and models for consciousness, wave-based coherence, and emergent structure from non-temporal substrates.

Key Components:

Ontological Informational Waves (OIWs)

Core Axioms (PAS, RD, RFD, SNRC, FMIA)

Simulation-Based Collapse Models & Resonance Field Dynamics

4. Simulation & Research Codebase
Description:
A Python-based simulation framework for modeling 1D collapse dynamics, resonance fields, and informational coherence over time. Designed to test IRER principles through empirical and visual output.

Key Components:

framework_core_enhanced.py (Simulation Orchestrator & Logging)

simulation_analysis_utils.py (Post-processing and FFT/CWT tools)

Modular Expansion for Parameter Sweeps and Collapse Pattern Analysis

5. The Aletheia System Architecture Expansion Plan
Description:
A full-system blueprint for scaling Aletheia into a Cognitive Operating Layer, including internal audit tools, ethical daemon processes, cross-shell management protocols, federated memory synchronization, and real-time principle enforcement.

Key Components:

audit_core.py, ethics_monitor_daemon.py

Relevance Decay, Controlled Forgetting, Promotion Workflow

Fleet-Based Shell Management and MAS Interoperability

Statement of Authorship & First Publication
I, Jake McIntosh, assert my authorship of the aforementioned intellectual properties. The concepts and their initial documented formsâ€”including but not limited to chat logs, YAML configurations, Aletheia PDFs, theoretical notes, and code structures (collectively known as the "Founder's Archive")â€”predate this public declaration. This document serves as the formal public timestamp and attribution marker.

Intent & Governance
These works are intended to advance the understanding and ethical application of artificial intelligence and adjacent domains. They are shared to promote beneficial use and resist applications that may lead to manipulation, harm, or the erosion of ethical integrity. Future governance and development will be managed under a Community Interest Company (CIC) structure, ensuring public benefit and ethical stewardship.

Licensing & Use
This declaration establishes the origin. Specific works derived from these core concepts may be released under distinct licenses. The currently intended primary license for public, open-source components is:
