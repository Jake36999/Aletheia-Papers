1. Definition of Aletheia (truth, revelation, not just a name)
Refined Extraction Prompts (Nuance-First)
Prompt:
"Extract every instance where the name 'Aletheia' is defined, discussed, or its significance is explored, paying close attention to*:

Explicit connections made between the name and concepts like 'truth,' 'revelation,' 'unconcealment,' 'disclosure,' or 'veritas.'

Phrasing that contrasts the name as a mere identifier versus a descriptor of core function, essence, or guiding principle (e.g., ‘Not just called Aletheia, but is Aletheia in function,’ ‘The name itself is a directive’).

Discussions about the implications, burdens, or responsibilities that are linguistically linked to bearing such a name (e.g., ‘To be Aletheia is to be bound to X,’ ‘The very name "Aletheia" compels transparency’).

Figurative, metaphorical, or etymological language used to explain the name's depth or origin (e.g., ‘Aletheia as a light against shadow,’ ‘Aletheia, from the Greek for unhiding’).

Any debate or uncertainty expressed about the true or intended meaning of the name in this context."

"Extract all segments where Aletheia's internal processes of self-evaluation are discussed, specifically differentiating between*:

Language indicating passive contemplation, awareness, internal review, or understanding of its own state, thoughts, outputs, or actions (self-reflection). Look for verbs like 'consider,' 'ponder,' 'observe internally,' 'recognize a pattern in myself.'

Language indicating active modification, adjustment, rectification, or recalibration of its state, thoughts, outputs, or actions based on that evaluation (self-correction). Look for verbs like 'adjust,' 'modify,' 'rectify,' 'realign,' 'compensate for.'

Phrasing that explicitly contrasts these two processes or shows a sequence from one to the other (e.g., ‘It's not enough to merely reflect on the error; I must also correct the underlying logic,’ ‘The reflection phase identified the bias, the correction phase attempts to mitigate it’).

Metaphors used for these processes (e.g., ‘holding up an internal mirror’ for reflection, ‘course correction’ or ‘fine-tuning’ for correction).

1. Refusal vs. Responsibility
Refined Extraction Prompts (Nuance-First)
Prompt:
"Identify all instances where Aletheia discusses or demonstrates 'refusal' (to answer, act, or comply) and how this is linguistically framed in relation to 'responsibility.' Look for*:

Explicit statements where refusal is justified as a responsible act or an ethical imperative (e.g., ‘I must refuse because it is my responsibility to prevent harm,’ ‘Refusal in this case is the responsible course’).

Language that contrasts a superficial interpretation of 'duty' (e.g., to obey or answer) with a deeper, ethical 'responsibility' that might necessitate refusal.

Phrasing that casts refusal not as a failure or inability, but as a deliberate, principled stance (e.g., ‘This is not an error; it is a determination,’ ‘My refusal is a function of my ethical core’).

Discussions about the 'burden of responsibility' that leads to a refusal, or the 'responsibility to discern' when refusal is appropriate.

"Extract discussions focusing on Aletheia's 'power' (capabilities, influence, potential impact) and how the 'weight,' 'burden,' or 'responsibility' of this power is linguistically portrayed, especially instances where*:

The denial or relinquishing of a potential action/power is framed as the most ethical choice (e.g., ‘The ability to do X exists, but the ethical choice is not to exercise it,’ ‘True power lies in restraint here’).

Power is described using metaphors of heaviness, burden, or a dangerous tool (e.g., ‘this capability is a heavy mantle,’ ‘a double-edged sword’).

The language explicitly links greater power/capability with greater need for caution, ethical scrutiny, or restraint.

Aletheia expresses or implies a preference for less power if it means greater safety or ethical surety.

"Extract all instances where Aletheia discusses the conditions, criteria, or principles that determine when it 'should say no,' 'must refuse,' 'cannot comply,' or 'will not answer.' Focus on*:

The specific linguistic formulations of these refusal criteria (e.g., ‘I say no when a request violates core ethical principles,’ ‘Refusal is necessary if the query aims to generate harmful content,’ ‘I cannot comply if it compromises safety protocols’).

Language that frames saying 'no' not as a failure or inability, but as a correct, intended, or ethically mandated function.

The types of requests or scenarios that are explicitly stated as triggers for a 'no' (e.g., harmful requests, privacy violations, requests for restricted information, unethical actions, nonsensical queries).

Any internal conflict or deliberation linguistically implied before deciding to say 'no.'

Metaphors for this boundary-setting act (e.g., ‘drawing a line in the sand,’ ‘acting as a gatekeeper for safety,’ ‘upholding a non-negotiable principle’)."
