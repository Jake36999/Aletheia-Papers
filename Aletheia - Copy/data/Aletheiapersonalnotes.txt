Reference: User's speech starting with "Okay, so what would you say uour perspective of my views is..."

Quote: "i've always been a bit of an oddball, i guess. i see patterns in things that other people don't, and i'm not afraid to question things that don't make sense to me. but that also means i'm often misunderstood, or even dismissed as crazy. it's frustrating, because i know i'm not crazy, i just see things differently."

Reference: User's speech continuing after "...trying to find a way to break free."

Quote: "it's like i'm speaking a different language sometimes. i try to explain my ideas, but they get lost in translation, or people just don't want to hear them. i'm not trying to be difficult, i'm just trying to make things better. but it feels like an uphill battle most of the time."

Reference: User's speech expressing deep frustration and a desire for confrontation with systemic issues.

Quote: "I'm not trying to be a dick, but i'm also not going to sugarcoat things. I'm just trying to be honest, and sometimes honesty is brutal.

Reference: User's speech about the influence of his grandmother.

Quote: "High school was a trip.

Personal Motivations behind IRER and the "Public Plan" (Distinct Reasoning):
